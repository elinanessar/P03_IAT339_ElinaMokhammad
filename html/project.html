                <h4>1. Pre-shoot planning:</h4>
                <p class="biography">During the pre-shoot planning phase, I prioritize effective communication with my
                    clients to ensure their vision is understood and incorporated into the photoshoot. Together, we
                    create a reference Pinterest board or album, where we save images that reflect the desired outcome,
                    helping us align our creative direction. Additionally, I take charge of finding suitable locations
                    and meticulously prepare clothing, makeup, and styling for the shoot, as I am experienced in
                    handling these aspects myself. By taking a hands-on approach, I guarantee that every detail is
                    carefully considered, leading to a successful and cohesive photoshoot that captures the essence of
                    my client's vision.</p>

                <h4>2. Day of the photoshoot:</h4>
                <p class="biography">On the day of the photoshoot, I ensured to arrive early
                    at the location to set up all the equipment and ensure everything was in place. Collaborating
                    closely with my assistant, we maintained a smooth workflow and seamless coordination, with them
                    providing valuable support throughout the day assisting with various tasks. Guiding the model
                    , I directed her to achieve the desired poses that perfectly captured the
                    creative concept.</p>

                <h4>3. Post-processing:</h4>
                <p class="biography">After the photoshoot, I diligently organized and securely backed up all raw image
                    files on Google Drive, ensuring the preservation of every valuable shot. With a discerning eye, I
                    carefully reviewed and selected the best images, limiting the final collection to a maximum of 10-15
                    shots that perfectly aligned with the client's vision and preferences. Leveraging my skills and
                    professional training, I conducted comprehensive color correction, retouching, and editing
                    processes. Utilizing Capture One, I initially edited the raw images, and then seamlessly
                    transitioned to Adobe Photoshop for advanced techniques like dodge and burn, frequency separation,
                    skin toning, and any other effects the client requested, such as a smoke filter or other artistic
                    enhancements. Finally, I delivered the final images in the agreed-upon format and within the
                    specified timeframe, ensuring the client received exceptional results that surpassed their
                    expectations.</p>

                <h4>4. Client feedback and follow-up:</h4>
                <p class="biography">After completing the photoshoot, I promptly reached out to the client to request
                    their feedback, ensuring that their expectations were fully met. Welcoming any revisions or
                    additional requests, I handled them with utmost attention and efficiency, striving to deliver
                    precisely what the client envisioned. Expressing sincere gratitude for their collaboration and
                    satisfaction, I valued their input and expressed my commitment to providing a seamless and enjoyable
                    experience. With open communication and a client-centric approach, I ensured that their vision came
                    to life, leaving them with memorable and captivating photographs that surpassed their expectations.

            <h2>Self Reflection.</h2>
            <p class="biography">
                I've honed my communication skills and the art of crafting visual guides with clients. On the shoot day,
                I've learned to orchestrate tasks efficiently with an assistant, ensuring smooth execution.
                Post-processing unveiled the power of software tools like Capture One and Photoshop, refining my editing
                finesse. Client feedback underscored the importance of adaptability and precise revisions, ultimately
                reinforcing the value of delivering portraits that resonate beyond pixels.
